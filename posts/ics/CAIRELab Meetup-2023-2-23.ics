SUMMARY:[CAIRELab Meetup] Influence of uncertainty estimation techniques on false-positive reduction in liver lesion detection
X-ALT-DESC;FMTTYPE=text/html:<br/><b>Influence of uncertainty estimation techniques on false-positive reduction in liver lesion detection</b><br/><i>by Ishaan Bhat<br/> ( Image Sciences Institute @ UMC Utrecht )</i><br/><br>External validation of radiomic studies is limited, although of utmost importance for the clinical implementation of radiomic models. The goal of this work is to build and externally validate a [18F]FDG PET radiomic model to predict overall survival in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).
    <br/>
	Two multicentre datasets of patients with operable HNSCC treated with neoadjuvant afatinib who underwent a baseline [18F]FDG PET/CT scan were included (EORTC 90111 trial: n=23, Unicancer Predictor trial: n=20). A Cox proportional hazards regression model using selected radiomic features and clinical characteristics (age and HPV status) was fitted on the training dataset and validated in the external validation set.<br/><br/> -------- <br/><br/> <b>Location</b> : V-01-022 (Building 3, LUMC)<br/><br/> <b>Online</b>   : <a href=https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3ameeting_NjAzOGJkNzEtMzMzMC00MjNkLThiNTQtOGY2MGM2ODUyMDJk%40thread.v2/0?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%22c4048c4f-dd54-4cbd-8049-5457aacd2fb8%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%229fd77952-d6d5-4ead-adcd-6d5b3de4fbbd%22%7d>Microsoft Teams Link</a><br/><br/> For more information refer our website: <a href=https://lumcaimeetup.github.io/?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=WeeklyEmailList>www.lumcaimeetup.github.io</a><br/>
